Subject: [PATCH] python-pgpy: drop pyproject.toml to avoid typing-extensions

PGPy's source distribution includes a minimal ``pyproject.toml`` which
triggers Buildroot's PEP517 build path. That pulls in the ``python-build``
helper along with its ``typing-extensions`` dependency for the host
environment. Since ``setup.cfg`` already provides all metadata and
``setup.py`` can handle the build, the ``pyproject.toml`` file is not
needed. Removing it allows Buildroot to fall back to the classic
setuptools build and eliminates the host ``typing-extensions``
requirement.
