Subject: [PATCH] pyproject: drop swig from build requirements

The swig binary is supplied by Buildroot as a host tool, so it should not
be listed as a Python build-system requirement. Removing it avoids the
build backend from attempting to fetch a non-existent "swig" Python
package and allows Buildroot's host-swig to satisfy the dependency.
