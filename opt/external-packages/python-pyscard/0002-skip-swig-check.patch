Subject: [PATCH] setup: skip swig presence check

Buildroot guarantees that the swig host tool is available when building
this package. The upstream setup script aborts early if swig cannot be
located on PATH. This causes the Buildroot build to fail even though
host-swig is provided. Remove the explicit check so the build proceeds
and relies on Buildroot's dependency handling.
