Subject: [PATCH] setup: skip swig presence check

Buildroot guarantees that the swig host tool is available when building
this package. The upstream setup script aborts early if swig cannot be
located on PATH. Remove the explicit check so the build proceeds and
relies on Buildroot's dependency handling.
