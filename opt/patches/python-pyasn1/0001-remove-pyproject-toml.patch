Subject: [PATCH] python-pyasn1: drop pyproject.toml to avoid typing-extensions

The pyasn1 source tarball ships a minimal ``pyproject.toml`` which triggers
Buildroot's PEP517 build path and pulls in the ``python-build`` tooling along
with its ``typing-extensions`` dependency for the host. Since the package is
pure Python and metadata is already provided via ``setup.cfg``, the file is
unnecessary. Removing it lets Buildroot fall back to setuptools and avoids the
extra host dependency.
