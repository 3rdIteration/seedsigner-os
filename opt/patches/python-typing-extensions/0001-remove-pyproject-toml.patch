Subject: [PATCH] python-typing-extensions: drop pyproject.toml

The upstream source includes a ``pyproject.toml`` which causes Buildroot to
invoke the PEP517 build backend and pull in the ``python-build`` tool along
with its ``tomli`` and ``typing-extensions`` host dependencies. For this
pure-Python package, ``setup.py``/``setup.cfg`` provide sufficient metadata so
the file can be removed. This lets Buildroot use the legacy setuptools flow
and avoid the extra host modules.
